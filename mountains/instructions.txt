To run MountainSort:
	go into day directory in MATLAB, run either of the following:
		mountain_batch('all') - for all possible channels
		mountain_batch('hippo') - for channels 'in hippocampus'
		mountain_batch('12 20 43') - for select channels

To use MountainSort GUI (for merging and discarding):
	go into 20181102/mountains/channel___ directory in terminal
	run: 'conda activate mountainlab'
		if fail, check ~/.bash_profile against sample in folder, specifically GITHUB_MATLAB and the last part for conda
	run: qt-mountainview --raw dataset/raw_data.mda --filt output/filt.mda.prv --pre output/pre.mda.prv --samplerate 30000 --firings output/firings.mda --cluster_metrics output/metrics.json
	do necessary modifications (only accepted and rejected tested)
	* use 'export cv2' to save session for continue modifying in teh future	
	* use 'export curated' and save as default 'firings.curated', mda prefix automatically added
	
To prune and export into cells
	go into 20181102/mountains/channel___ directory in MATLAB
	run: refinement
	once done, press export
	cells will be generated in individual sessions
	folder will be curated in mountains/channel___ with both pre and post pruned spikes
