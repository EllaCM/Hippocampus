20190919 update:
	in the future, output files will be ~.mda instead of ~.mda.prv (command to use GUI needs to be updated)
	in the future, preprocessing steps will change, from bandpass-whiten to whiten-artifacts (command for GUI and sort.sh.txt to be updated)

New GUI command something like this:
qt-mountainview --raw dataset/raw_data.mda --filt output/pre2.mda --pre output/pre.mda --samplerate 30000 --firings output/firings.mda --cluster_metrics output/metrics.json

As of 22 Jan 2020, use the following to view:
To interpret GUI:
Raw -> rplhighpass version.
Filt -> after passing flat 250 thresholding.
Filt + whiten -> after passing flat 250, whiten, 25 std dev thresholding.

qt-mountainview --raw dataset/bef_250.mda --filt output/raw_data.mda --pre output/pre2.mda --samplerate 30000 --firings output/firings.mda --cluster_metrics output/metrics.json



To run MountainSort:
	go into day directory in MATLAB, run either of the following:
		mountain_batch('all') - for all possible channels
		mountain_batch('hippo') - for channels 'in hippocampus'
		mountain_batch('12 20 43') - for select channels

To use MountainSort GUI (for merging and discarding):
	go into 20181102/mountains/channel___ directory in terminal
	run: 'conda activate mountainlab'
		if fail, check ~/.bash_profile against sample in folder, specifically GITHUB_MATLAB and the last part for conda
	run: qt-mountainview --raw dataset/raw_data.mda --filt output/filt.mda.prv --pre output/pre.mda.prv --samplerate 30000 --firings output/firings.mda --cluster_metrics output/metrics.json
	do necessary modifications (only accepted and rejected tested)
	* use 'export cv2' to save session for continue modifying in teh future	
	* use 'export curated' and save as default 'firings.curated', mda prefix automatically added
	
To prune and export into cells
	go into 20181102/mountains/channel___ directory in MATLAB
	run: refinement
	once done, press export
	cells will be generated in individual sessions
	folder will be curated in mountains/channel___ with both pre and post pruned spikes

To reload previous cut
	go into 20181102/mountains/channel___ directory in terminal
	run: 'qt-mountainview ______' with the .mv2 file 

To clear space (when error for running low on disk space)
	cd into /tmp/mountainlab-tmp
	run 'rm -r *'
